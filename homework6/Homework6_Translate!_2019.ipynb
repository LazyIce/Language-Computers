    "For \"TrigramLanguageModel\" model, it keeps three dictionares: trigramCounts, bigramCounts and unigramCounts. These three dictionaries record the number of different trigram, bigram and unigram respectively. The variable vocab_size counts the number of different words in the corpus and the variable corpus_size counts the number of words in the corpus. Here, the model uses the brown corpus. Besides, the \"TrigramLanguageModel\" will calculate the the log-probability as score of the sentence based on the data in the corpus. When calculating the score, more trigrams in sentence can be found in the corpus, the score would be higher. The bigram will get less score than trigram and unigram will get less score than bigram. \n",

For example, our translation still has some grammer errors like “the Bostonians are taking in with the arms opens at gastronomic”. Also, our translation cannot solve the situation that one word can be adjective or verb. Our translation cannot choose the correct part of speech for it. Besides, our translation doesn't have punctuations and capitalization."

    "\n",
    "Barnes would say that whether poussa implies more vigour than the English ‘grew’: hence 4)’s ‘throve’ and 5)’s addition of the intensifying ‘up’. However, google translation uses the word \"pushed\". Also, Barnes would consider that whether this translation can keep the balance of ‘de fortes mains, de belles couleurs’. The google translation doesn't keep the balance. Besides, Barnes would ask what to do about belles couleurs. All five translators agree that there is no way of preserving the plural form. However, google translation keeps the plural form. The google translation seems to stick closer to the original sentence structure and are less ‘interpretative’.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Your answer to Question 13b \n",
    "\n",
    "For the original French sentence, it is a calm, balanced sentence, in three parts, with a triple alliteration, the part containing the second and third ‘p’ making up the central phrase. The choice for petitesse lies normally between ‘paltriness’ and ‘pettiness’, neither of which is perfect, as they have a slightly more disapproving tinge than petitesse. For google translation, instead of \"pettiness\" or 'paltriness', it uses \"smallness\", which loses the meaning. Also, the two words 'now', 'knew', both a wail of assonance and a stuttering of rhythm far from the original.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Your answer to Question 13c\n",
    "\n",
    "I prefer to read the Lydia Davis version. Davis’s Madame Bovary is a linguistically careful version, in the modern style, rendered into an unobtrusively American English. It conveys the precision of Flaubert’s prose in this novel, while its syntactical mirroring of the French sometimes brings us closer to Flaubert. Also, Lydia Davis’s version uses an act of the imagination as well as a technician’s proficiency, which provides a more acceptable version. Besides, Davis is profoundly out of sympathy, which can provide us a more objective translation version. This is also the reason that I always think that translators should not bring their own worships to the original authors of books into their translation work."
